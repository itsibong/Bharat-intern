                    <h2>Learn Javascript - is fun way</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that is widely used for web development.
                        JavaScript is the only language that can be executed natively in web browsers, making it the
                        language of the web.
                        JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for both front-end and back-end development,
                        as well as for building mobile and desktop applications.
                        JavaScript has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it easy to build complex
                        web applications.
                        JavaScript is dynamically typed, which means that variables can hold values of different types
                        at different times during execution.
                        The latest ECMAScript specification, ES2022, includes new language features such as private
                        class fields and numeric separators.
                        JavaScript has a vibrant community of developers who contribute to open source projects, share
                        knowledge and best practices, and develop new tools and techniques for working with the
                        language.
                        JavaScript is constantly evolving, with new features being added to the specification on a
                        regular basis, which has helped to keep it relevant and adaptable to changing needs.</p>
